# InvoicerApp

This is a MEAN web application for customer invoicing system, backend api is built using expressjs and mongodb is used for database and then front end is built using angular and that will connect with api and fetch the customers and invoices data and we can perform CRUD functionality on customers and invoices.

In the project directory, you can run:

## Purpose

I made this is a MEAN web application for customer invoicing system to simplify the process of generating invoices person to person and storing customers details and his/her invoices at the the same time. So this invoicer will store his/her all invoices with required details (paid/unpaid, due date).
